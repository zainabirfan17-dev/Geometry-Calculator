# üßÆ Geometry Calculator

**A versatile Python program to calculate area, perimeter, diagonals, and visualize polygons!**  

This project allows users to interactively explore geometric properties for multiple polygons‚Äîperfect for students, educators, or anyone interested in geometry.

## üåü Features

- Supports multiple polygons:  
  - **Triangle**, **Square**, **Rectangle**, **Pentagon**, **Hexagon**, **Heptagon**, **Octagon**, **Nanagon**, **Decagon**
- Calculates:
  - Area
  - Perimeter
  - Number of diagonals
  - Diagonal length  
- Provides **visual ASCII pictures** for:
  - Triangle  
  - Square  
  - Rectangle
- Advanced features:
  - Let users input **custom dimensions** for any shape  
  - Calculate **how many squares can fit inside a rectangle**

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. Run the program using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python "GEOMETRY CALCULATOR/main.py"
   ```

2. The program will prompt you to enter the polygon name:

   Example: square, rectangle, triangle, or any other supported polygon.

3. Enter the dimensions when prompted:

   Example: side lengths, width & height, etc.

4. View results including area, perimeter, diagonals, diagonal length, and ASCII diagrams.

5. Type exit to quit the program.

## üìä Example Usage

```text
Enter the name of the shape (rectangle,square OR both OR any other polygon): square
Enter the side length of the square: 5
Area = 25
Diagonal length = 7.0710678118654755
Number of Diagonals = 2
Square(side=5)
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
```

```text
Enter the name of the shape (rectangle,square OR both OR any other polygon): rectangle
Enter the width of the rectangle: 8
Enter the height of the rectangle: 4
Area = 32
Diagonal Length = 8.94427190999916
Number of Diagonals = 2
Perimeter = 24
Rectangle(width=8, height=4)
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Math module** for calculations
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Classes and inheritance for polygons, regular polygons, triangles, rectangles, and squares
- **ASCII art** for visual representation of shapes

## üîß How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! You can:

- Add visualizations for more polygons  
- Improve ASCII drawings or make them dynamic  
- Add new geometric calculations like angles or diagonals for irregular polygons

## Note

I do plan to expand this project into a full app once I have the required skills to do so but for now I will not rush it and leave it as it is.
This is my biggest acheivement so far as it is my own creation and I look forward to grow more <3
